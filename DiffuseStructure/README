Structure Format
 
Essential Parts:
-   	Metric Tensor: [Å, deg]
3x3 double precision real matrix as G, header needs to specify the sequence of matrix
-   	Symmetry of the average structure
32 Characters that have the space group symbol
-   	Number of unit cells in a, b, c direction
3 unsigned integer
-   	number of atoms (NA) in file
1 unsigned integer
-   	List of atom types that are present in the structure, including atomic number, charge and isotope
         	Four columns:
o   atom type: 2 characters
o   Atomic number, unsigned integer number
o   Charge, signed integer number
o   Isotope, unsigned integer number
-   	Atom type and atomic coordinates: this should be a table with 9 columns and NA lines
o   1st column: Atom id, 1 integer
o   2nd column: Atom type, 1 integer (identifies the type according to number in list of atom types
o   3rd – 5th column: x,y,z coordinates in the supercell from 0-1, 3 double precision real, numbers
o   6th – 9th column: unit cell identifier, coordinates of the atoms unit cell in the supercell and site in the average unit cell, 4 integers
-   	Flags: Listed as flag name, data type Boolean, brackets as explanation what does
o   Super structure
o   Asymmetric unit (only asymmetric unit is stored)
o   Are periodic boundary conditions sensible
o   Homogeneity (Is it sensible to collapse the structure in one unit-cell, should be no for structures with drastically different parts, e.g. domains. If this is yes then the average crystallographic cell needs to be stored)
 
Metadata:
o   Timestamp
o   Software: Generated by software including its version version
 
Optional Parts:
-   	If possible can we kind of attach a script/macro that created the structure?, e.g. containing Interaction Hamiltonian used in the generation of the structure
-   	Average structure this should be a table with  12 columns
o   1st column: Atom type, 1 integer (identifies the type according to number in list of atom types
o   2nd  – 4th column: x,y,z coordinates
o   5th column: average occupancy of the atom type in 1st column on this site
o   6th column: Uiso
o   7th – 12th column: u_ij
-   	Molecular identity
o   2 integers, 1st labelling type of molecule, 2nd labelling number of molecule
-   	Magnetic spin
o   3 real numbers, components of spin vectors along crystal axis
-   	Property flags: List of NA integers TO BE EXTENDED BY DISCUS AND RMC WITH THEIR FLAGS
o   Surface atom
o   Domain number
